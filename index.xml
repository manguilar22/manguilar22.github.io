      <description>What are data centers ? In the advent of cloud computing, companies are preparing to clear land to make room for warehouses. These warehouses are made to house the worlds computing power. Companies rely on these warehouses and their performance to ensure the best services provided to their customers. These warehouses are running software that is responsible for streaming services and other business offerings. However, these warehouse use a lot of energy and this essay plans on showing how different forms of media try to raise awareness.</description>

      <description>Top Super Powers in computing. This section will highlight the most powerful nations in computing. All these visualizations were done in the Wolfram Language. The visualizations hope to achieve a visual comprehension of the issue.  This image demonstrates the heat dissipation created by a CPU. A CPU is responsible for carrying out all computations and therefore creates heat. We can see in this picture the heat produced covers almost the entire board.</description>

      <description>Genre Analysis Media: Scientific Article An article asessesing the energy consumption of data centers. The article states the energy required to keep a data center operational will increase in the future. This is because streaming and social-media companies need to expand to keep up with the ever-growing demand.
Media: Video YouTube
Introduction The topic of focus is cloud computing, hoping to explore more about cloud computing. Not the benefits people get from cloud computing, but the consequences.</description>
