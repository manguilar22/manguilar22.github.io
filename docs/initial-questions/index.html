  <h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>As a society we have becomed accustomed to instant entertainment. We personally get
satisfaction from the many services that are sold online. Subscription based packages that include
movies, music, or vendor preference. These services are multi-billion dollar industry with great
investment in creating large warehouses to store computers. These warehouse, known as data-
centers are responsible for providing all their content to paying customers. However, these
warehouse are getting bigger and bigger and being built in exotic locations. The discourse of the
scientific community in the field of computational sciences argue that it is detrimental to the
environment. The environment is a popular subject in current events. Therefore, the intent is to
show how the infrastructure of your favorite internet companies stay silent toward environmental
issues. The articles highlight the initial progress of creating new methods for successful energy
consumption. The research material focuses on what the underlying issue is with data centers and
their economic investment in energy is required for theses warehouses to be operational.
Therefore, the research is designed to demonstrate how modification can be made to current
infrastructure to a more optimal model. This is known as green computing, and it tries to to
create a less resource intensive environment for computers. This is a cohesive action by the
scientific community to improve the quality of data centers. Ultimately, creating an
environmentally aware workforce and guilty free entertainment.

<h1 id="green-computing">Green Computing</h1>
<p>Green computing projects can improve sustainability of computing resources. As
there can be several methodologies for developing green computing projects, assessing the quality of
these projects can help in determining the feasibility of a project to a particular application. In
addition, having a tool for measuring quality factors determined by the stakeholders of the domain
can further support decision making when differentiating between multiple computing projects or
determining quality features in a certain project. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2018.00096">This paper</a> presents a measuring model for assessing
the quality of engineering projects in the domain of green computing. Also, a case study based on the
proposed model is presented. This article hopes to facilitate the transition form classical data center
methodologies to green computing architectures. Using quality assurance models, one can measure
and compare results and performance against a classical model. This way it helps to convince others
to adopt a green computing methodology.</p>
