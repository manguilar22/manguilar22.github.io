The article states the energy required to keep a data center operational will increase in the future. This is because streaming and social-media companies need to expand to keep up with the ever-growing demand.\nMedia: Video YouTube\nIntroduction The topic of focus is cloud computing, hoping to explore more about cloud computing. Not the benefits people get from cloud computing, but the consequences. The consequences that come from building monumental warehouses that only purpose is to store computers. These computers are working in unison and require a lot of electricity for a warehouse to run the entire year. These computers will never turn off and will possibly be running for years until something breaks or re-purposed. Cloud computing is phenomena that is causes havoc to the environment. I want to explore the consequences cloud computing has on climate change. People who study computer science or related technology fields, will specifically know the purpose of cloud computing. Cloud computing is responsible for the rise in many streaming services. Better quality of phone calls, video conference, and social media websites. Everyday we use multiple of electronic devices that contains software that is constantly gathering personal information. All this information being collected requires a lot of space in storage and many computers to maintain the data useful and accessible. So, people can watch their favorite television shows and not consider that it affects the environment.   Structure and Delivery An academic article and a video are the genres to be analyzed. These two had to drastically different to specifically recall minuet details about both. Both of these genres use different vocabulary, which is interesting. It is interesting because there is a clear divide in interest when people discuss cloud computing. There is an academic interest, whose purpose is to advance the science to perform extraordinary tasks. Then there is the consumer or non-technical people who don’t care for the science of distributed computer systems. They only want the numerous services that are being offered by businesses for streaming.\nThe message is organized by giving the problem in the first paragraph. This opening passage announces all the statistics and promises of technology giants and their plan on expanding. This expansion will affect the environment, and then they talk about solutions. The solution to the problem will be to create different layouts for a data center. To use less computers with more space in between to cool down. Or to use a large concentration of computers in a single point with constant cooling. Another plan is to use hot and cold hallways to allocate machines based on use. Another plan is to build data centers where it is naturally cold. The elements that occur naturally, can help with cooling enormous data centers. There are limitations to what information that can be displayed in this genre. The article is a scientific article, therefore restricting itself to those with specialized knowledge. However, genre number two mitigates that by providing visuals for comprehensions. It also can not hypothesize about future ideas. This is a restriction academic papers have. It is a statement that is being presented, for the viewers consumption.\nIt makes a person understand there is actual interest in the topic. The scientific community are recognizing the problem and the issue that arises from creating huge landfills. The data in the video is presented in a natural way. It is an introductory video. It is showing the person what is cloud computing. It has no offerings that can be listed in the video. It is a video with visuals. Ultimately, making it easier to understand because of graphical representation of complex ideas. The graphical representations are very minimal as to not distract the viewer and the author’s narration is very well paced; with clear explanations. The complex ideas are the technical terms that are being introduced and the actions theses words take. Since, visuals are provided this makes the video easily shareable and could be understood by a more diverse audience then the scientific article.   Audience and Purpose The audiences for these genres are different. Their is an academic article that focuses on the consequences of how much energy is required to use a data center. The audience for this article is targeting is anyone with interest in data centers. Specifically, data centers’ correlation with global warming. This article highlights that data center construction does cause a dent in the environment. A dent, being unforeseen consequences from the power required to run a successful data center. Audiences may not know what a data center is. If they do; it will be easier to explain cloud computing. The audience should know what is a data center, cloud computing, and streaming services. Streaming services, even if they don’t know what it is. A majority of people are subscribed to least one. Even if they have no streaming service they are personally subscribed. Free websites with billions of users also cause this problem of harming the environment. Being an article in a obscure website may cause people to skim the article. Having small letters does not help either. Small Text makes it hard for other people to read. People with not so good eyesight. Having a lot of technical jargon can distract a person with short attention span or no interest in the field. The purpose of this topic is to inform. To inform people that having multiple applications on your phone that do the same thing is harming the environment. However, we are a capitalistic society and it is natural for companies to compete with each other. People, should just be aware of what it means when a new streaming service is announced. All the logistics that go into building a successful product with a safe haven where it can run. The same haven, being multi-million dollar projects of clearing land to create computer warehouses. These computer warehouse, called data centers take copious amounts of electricity for them to run correctly. The intended audience for this video is for anyone wanting to know more about cloud computing. This video demystifies misconceptions about cloud computing. It also highlights all the great things cloud computing has done for business, schools, and personal endeavors. They may know what is beneficial to them personally. Such as, everyone can benefit from cloud storage. To facilitate the organization, sorting, and archiving of important documents. Instead of having them personally in their personal computer; they can have it elsewhere. They will want to know more as the benefits are being listed.\nA person can find themselves, stopping the video over and over. As the illustrations are very detailed with many characters communicating with each other. If the people in the illustrations did not get your attention. Then there are red words found within the picture that highlight what the drawn people are screaming at each other. The purpose of this video is to inform and persuade. The video informs you of what is possible thanks to cloud computing. Using the strategy of visuals to captivate its audience. The visual are minimalist in the color scheme as to not distract the viewer. The narration of the author is well paced and very clear. The video does not market any cloud computing offering, instead it is an overview. An overview of the tool that is cloud computing and how it can help you with your personal or intellectual pursuits. Informal language is present in the video, it comes of as if having a conversation. The presenter does not use vocabulary words, however uses history events and assumes you are familiar with them. It starts with a history lesson of how computing got to the stage of being used in the cloud. From the renaissance, Turing machine, and modern computing mainframes. If a person is not educated in computer history, this is all useless nonsense. Red text to highlight what the people in the illustration are screaming at each other. They seem to scream to each other in pictures. This is to highlight international communication. Or it can be about size of a cloud system has to cater to its users.   Rhetorical Issues: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos The scientific article quotes what Facebook says about increasing users. Facebook plans to expand the world-wide infrastructure of the internet to reach even more remote places! By expanding the internet infrastructure, they project they will get more users for their social media platform. Ultimately, gathering more information from their users and selling to companies. The genre is trying to evoke a feeling of hopelessness. Reason, being the article opens with a comparison of how much energy is being consumed in a small time. Comparisons help gain a vision of the magnitude of the problem. It is a scientific article that is all you need to know to prove its legitimacy. It also has several authors that contributed to the article. Just making it more important. This genre establishes credibility with the amount of subscribers the uploader of the YouTube video has. The video also has more positive reviews than negative. Ensuring that a multitude of people have endorsed the video as useful and professional content. This video also has recent comments, showing that the subject of cloud computing is growing. It is growing and maturing, causing people to search for videos like this to learn more about the subject. Excitement, it is the emotion the genre is invoking. Excitement, in the possibilities of what cloud computing can do to your business, school, and personal projects. This genre establishes credibility with the amount of subscribers the uploader of the YouTube video has. The video also has more positive reviews than negative. Ensuring that a multitude of people have endorsed the video as useful and professional content. This video also has recent comments, showing that the subject of cloud computing is growing. It is growing and maturing, causing people to search for videos like this to learn more about the subject.   Conclusion Although, cloud computing has existed for a while. Since the beginning of the twentieth century; there is still a shroud of mystery surrounding it. It is still a subject surrounded by much mysticism when you are not a technology oriented person. However, for experts in the subject matter, also feel the same feeling of impotence. Cloud computing is changing and transforming rapidly and developers are expected to keep up with modern terminology. The purpose of analyzing these genres was to supplement anybody reading this to have additional information about cloud computing. Not just that, but also make sure the main topic is being addressed. The academic article addresses this topic thoroughly by giving statistics and companies future plans in expanding their business. The business of cloud computing is helpful to the economy, since many business will further rely on cloud technologies. However, the public must be aware that creating these giant warehouses that allow for cloud computing are damaging for the environment.

Adaptive Energy-Aware Algorithms for Minimizing Energy Consumption and SLA Violation in Cloud Computing. IEEE Access, Access, IEEE, 6, 55923–55936. https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872750  Summary ...  n cloud computing, high energy consumption and service-level agreements (SLAs) violation are the challenging issues considering that the demand for computational power is growing rapidly, thereby requiring large-scale cloud data centers. Although, there are many existing energy-aware approaches focusing on minimizing energy consumption while ignoring the SLA violation at the time of a virtual machine (VM) selection from overloaded hosts. Also, they do not consider that the current network traffic causes performance degradation and thus may not really reduce SLA violation under a variety of workloads. In this context, this paper proposes three adaptive models, namely, gradient descent-based regression (Gdr), maximize correlation percentage (MCP), and bandwidth-aware selection policy (Bw), that can significantly minimize energy consumption and SLA violation. Energy-aware methods for overloaded host detection and VM selection from an overloaded host are necessary to improve the energy efficiency and SLA violation of a cloud data center after migrating all VM from underloaded host turn to idle host, which switch to energy-saving mode is also beneficial. Gdr and MCP are adaptive energy-aware algorithms based on the robust regression model, for overloaded host detection. A Bw dynamic VM selection policy selects VM according to the network traffic from the overloaded host under SLAs. Experimental results on the real workload traces show that the proposed algorithms reduce energy consumption while maintaining the required performance levels in a cloud data center using a CloudSim simulator to validate the proposed algorithms.

The infrastructure resources in distributed green cloud data centers (DGCDCs) are shared by multiple heterogeneous applications to provide flexible services to global users in a high-performance and low-cost way. It is highly challenging to minimize the total cost of a DGCDC provider in a market, where bandwidth prices of Internet service providers (ISPs), electricity prices, and the availability of renewable green energy all vary with geographical locations. Unlike existing studies, this paper proposes a spatial task scheduling and resource optimization (STSRO) method to minimize the total cost of their provider by cost-effectively scheduling all arriving tasks of heterogeneous applications to meet tasks\u0026rsquo; delay-bound constraints.     Evaluation ...  The power consumption of data centers has huge impacts on environments. Researchers are seeking to find effective solutions to make data centers reduce power consumption while keep the desired quality of service and service level objectives.
