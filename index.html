<p>Demonstrate the harm that large scale data centers can have on the environment. As cloud computing rises in popularity the issue will become more obvious. Therefore, measures must be employed in the field of computation to not cause irreversible damage to the environment. These change can already be seen in major companies, this is known as <strong>green computing</strong>. This website will offer an overview and comprehenive take on how an ecological problem is being improved. It demonstrates basic information on the what data-centers are and their ecological consequences.</p>

<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p>       The main environmental concern in computing should be energy consumption. It is common knowledge in the IT sector that data centers are enormous warehouses housing the computers responsible for our favorite streaming services, social media websites, and gaming platforms. These warehouse exhaust enormous amounts of heat and also require large amounts of energy to maintain. It has been found that the heat exhaustion produced and constant refrigeration  of computers is detrimental to the environment. However, this harm to the environment does not need to continue. Green computing is a set of practices that encourages reducing energy consumption and heat exhaustion. By this means it is possible to create a quantifiable method of measurement. This system will allow engineers in the field of computing to know how energy emissions can be improved. Ultimately, progress is being made in other scientific fields  that supplement computing power. This has been shown to be true with recent developments in energy-aware electrical components.</p>
<p>       The adoption of green computing is possible. Green computing is a practice of implementing computers in a data-center with environmental concerns. This is a doctrine of practice for engineers who want to reduce energy-consumption, without hindering performance. Green computing is promising because it is has easy adoptability. In order to participate in green computing, certain practices must be followed. However, the ease of adoption of the practice of green computing is due to the tooling. Tools are implemented on a computer in a data center.  These tools are a collection of software many engineers are familiar with. This computer software has been used for several years and is maintained by successful companies. This makes it easy for engineers and architects to adopt green computing practices because the tools are already widely used. The tools include a collection of software that is high quality and produced by reputable companies. The hard part of investing in creating a energy-aware data-center is providing a never failing service with ecological constraints in place.
Modernization and progress are already happening in scientific fields that supplement modern computers.  Modernization in electrical components is also proceeding to be released to the general public as definite solutions to ecological concerns regarding computing, such as, building “energy-aware” electrical components that can be placed in regular computer hardware. These will be responsive to the energy that is required at the time.</p>
<p>       These electrical components are very impressive, but yet are not mass produced and are still in experimental phases. The demand for modern-computing is too big for the feasible production of these electrical components at mass scale.  A data-center architect will have to take into consideration the voltage amount produced from the energy outlets. This in turn can make engineers focus on the distribution of power across a data-center. This voltage has to be monitored concurrently with the computers resources. This is can be performed with specialized hardware, such as a voltage frequency driver.
This topic has been very exciting to research. My major is in computer science and the maintainability of distributed application is my interest. I am very concerned with performance and now more than ever realizing the consequences of cloud computing.  Advances in monitoring and logging tools can greatly increase adoption in green computing.  Objections can be made that how is it possible to improve energy consumption in a data center. The professional consensus is that there should be specialized units of measurement used to quantify a data-centers energy consumption. There are also special constraints that can be employed  that help reduce environmental impact with tools many engineers are already familiar with. This is great because it encourages easy adoption and benefits the environment.
To encourage adoption in green computing the general public has to be educated in how to implement it, so whenever the chance arises other professionals will be able to contribute. If more professionals in the fields of engineering are aware of green computing then it will benefit the impact as a whole. Ecological results in the filed of computing are done  by innovators in other fields! Being aware of this topic can make the average person capable of having a suggestion. This suggestion could have an environmental impact.</p>
